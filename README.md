*More FYI: just for the fun of it, see below how many SEPARATE things you had to install if we would have continued with VS2015 :)*
- ~~Visual Studio 2015 Community or Professional Edition with Update 3 (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409)~~
- ~~Latest Azure SDK (2.9.6 current) (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518003&clcid=0x409)~~
- ~~SQL Server Data Tools for VS2015 (https://msdn.microsoft.com/mt186501)~~

### Setup
- open solution in VS
- CTRL + Q and search for Package Manager Console
- once opened select the Data project as the default project (second dropdown)
- run the following command: Update-Database
- that's it, just make sure the CloudStorage project is selected as the default one, hit F5 and enjoy! (VS should restore all missing packages automatically)

**Note: this will NOT be deployable to Linux because of it's dependency to WindowsAzure.Storage nuget package**
